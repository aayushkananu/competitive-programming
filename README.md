# (In python-gg🥵)

I need internships and I'm learning everything on my own. So here's the repo where I have uploaded all my learnings for the purpose of tracking my mistakes and things I've learned so far. JK, I just want to maintain a streak on Github and act nerdy. HA!
Cringe. Ok bye. Have fun exploring my repo!🙏
